<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
    Because we rely on third-party vendors, you need to install some stuff
    first.
</p>
<p>
    Go into your docker container with the following command

    <pre><code class="bash">docker exec -it php71 bash</code></pre>

    and run the following command

    <pre><code class="bash">composer install</code></pre>

    after that, you should be ready for your first exception.
</p>
<h2>Your first exercise</h2>
<p>Each exercise contains of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Read the instructions</li>
    <li>Complete the code in the exercises folder</li>
    <li>Watch the wonderful output on the page</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Before each exercise, you can use the <a href="/reset_index.php">reset index button</a> to reset
    the index.
</p>
<p>You can find the exercises under the exercise button in the menu.</p>
