11854320;cameras_sales,digital_cameras,ricoh;digital_cameras;Ricoh CX 6;<b>Imaging processing performance that places a premium on pure image quality.</b>\n<b>Back-illuminated CMOS sensor + Smooth Imaging Engine IV</b>\nThe CX6 boasts a back-illuminated CMOS image sensor combined with advanced Smooth Imaging Engine IV image processing. Poorly-lit indoor or night scenes are rendered in pure, unblemished quality, as of course are brightly-lit subjects. An output pixel interpolation algorithm residing in dedicated logic circuits in the imaging engine reduces loss of detail in highlights to faithfully recreate high-contrast scenes exactly as they appear to the naked eye.\n\n<b>RICOH Pure Image Quality Technology</b>\nThe imaging philosophy that lies at the root of all Ricoh digital cameras: not just "high image quality" but "pure image quality, true to what is perceived by the naked eye." This is achieved through three core technologies—a low-distortion lens with true-to-life imaging properties, an image sensor with superior high-sensitivity performance, and an imaging engine that reproduces images in minute detail—that have been designed and developed as a single mechanism, offering unsurpassed resolution and faithful, unaffected color reproduction.\n\n<b>Breathtakingly pure beauty with each shot.</b>\n<b>Breakthrough noise reduction function</b>\nThe camera's noise reduction algorithm processes the image signal as it is output from the CMOS image sensor, reducing the image noise that tends to occur in photographs taken at high sensitivities. The result is beautiful, limpid photographs with details, tones, and colors as vivid as those seen in the original subject.\n\n<b>Super-resolution technology for high-resolution image quality</b>\n<b>for everything from normal photography to zoom and macro shooting.</b>\nThe CX6's super-resolution technology discerns the outlines, details, and gradations in the image automatically and processes the photograph based on the optimal settings for each. This allows the camera to record images with even higher resolution than with previous models.\n\n<b>Corrects for even slight hand-motion blur.</b>\n<b>Image sensor shift image stabilizer</b>\nThe image sensor shift image stabilizer function reduces the hand-motion blurring that tends to occur in situations such as telephoto and macro shooting. When blurring is detected, the CMOS sensor automatically compensates by shifting in a direction that eliminates the blur.

12576582;cameras_sales,digital_cameras,fujifilm;digital_cameras;Fujifilm FinePix S2980;Perfect for those looking to step up from a basic compact to a camera with more features. The FinePix S2980 camera has a generous 18x zoom, 14-megapixel resolution and an electronic viewfinder to compliment its LCD view screen.\n\nIn addition to the same core specifications of the previous S2950, the S2980 also features a brighter LCD screen, faster startup time, longer flash range and a shorter time between shots.\n\n<b>14-megapixel resolution and 18x optical zoom</b>\n\nA 14-megapixel CCD sensor delivers large, high-resolution images, while a 18x optical zoom gets you close to the action.\n\n<b>From wide angle to extreme telephoto at the flick of a switch</b>\n\nAn 18x Fujinon optical zoom provides the equivalent of a 28-504mm lens on a full-frame digital camera, but at a fraction of the size and weight! The wide-angle end focal lengths will be popular with those shooting landscapes, street scenes and interiors, while extreme telephoto settings will get you closer to the action when shooting sports or wildlife. Experiment with intermediate zoom settings when shooting portraits, still life and travel photography.\n\n<b>28mm wide angle</b>\n\nWhere some bridge cameras sacrifice the wide-angle part of the zoom range to get extra reach at the telephoto end, the S2900 series gives you the best of both worlds, starting with a very useful 28mm (equivalent) wide-angle zoom setting.\n\nAt 28mm you’ll be able to take in those big-sky landscapes, shoot interiors in great detail and cope easily with large group shots.\n\n<b>14 megapixel resolution for great image quality</b>\n\nWith 14-megapixels you’ll not be left wanting more when it comes to resolution. The FinePix S2900 series produces JPEG files measuring up to 4288x3216 pixels, which is big enough to produce prints larger than A3, or allow creative cropping on your home PC without loosing quality. The Fujifilm CCD sensor captures the world around you in vivid colour and stunning clarity.\n\n<b>Dual image stabilisation</b>\n\nCamera shake at long shutter speeds can ruin an otherwise golden moment with image blur.\n\nThe FinePix S2900 series tackles this head on by combining high ISO sensitivity with sensor-shift image stabilisation – great for photography indoors without using flash\n\n<b>High ISO sensitivity (max. ISO6400)</b>\n\nDon’t just rely on flash in low light: adjust the sensitivity all of the way from ISO64 to ISO6400, according to shooting conditions. Or use a higher ISO value in good light to ensure that shutter speeds are fast enough to freeze any action.\n\n* At ISO3200 and 6400, number of recorded pixels is limited to a maximum 3 megapixels. At full resolution (14 megapixels), sensitivity is limited to a maximum ISO1600.

12435196;cameras_sales,canon,digital_cameras;digital_cameras;Canon PowerShot ELPH 520 HS;<b>An Ultra-Slim High Performer.</b>\nIn the twelve years since the original ELPH was instantly and universally proclaimed an icon of style, successive ELPH cameras have remained at the forefront of design even while boasting the very latest in digital technology. Now, opening a new era of ELPH design, the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS digital camera is both homage to the original ELPH and astonishing synthesis of Canon's leadership in technical advancements. A mere 0.76 inches thick, it is the world's thinnest 12x zoom camera*. Canon's pursuit of perfection has driven the development of new miniaturization including a new lens and new 10.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor that, powered by Canon's DIGIC 5 Image Processor, create images as breathtakingly beautiful as the camera itself. It's also packed with the latest Canon technologies including Smart AUTO with new Face ID and Full HD Video. Brimming with a full range of advanced technologies that automatically optimize the image quality of every shot, the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS digital camera makes the ultimate style icon incredibly effortless.\n\n<b>Incredibly Thin Design</b>\nCanon's unwavering commitment to equipping an ultra-thin, clean-profiled ELPH with 12x zooming power required a redesign of the lens, sensor and other technologies. This pursuit of perfection paid off, creating the world's thinnest camera with a 12x zoom. At an astonishingly thin 0.76 inches, it is significantly slimmer than competitors' 12x zoom models.\n\n<b>12x Optical Zoom and 28mm Wide-Angle Lens</b>\nNewly designed to custom-fit the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS digital camera's incredibly thin profile, the camera's 12x Optical Zoom and 28mm Wide-Angle Lens is a marvel of optical technology. The Wide-Angle lens gives you more to work with in every shot, adding depth, perspective and grandeur as called for. Landscapes, city scenes, family shots and more all benefit from the extra width. With a 12x Optical Zoom, no shot is beyond your reach. You'll love the flexibility it gives you when shooting: from a single vantage point you can capture an unlimited number of different images simply by zooming in and out. It also incorporates the latest in Canon UA lens technology, suppressing lens aberration for outstanding image quality throughout the entire zoom range. The camera's sensor was specifically designed for this lens, so even at the long end of the zoom images are bright and clear.\n\n<b>UA Lens Technology</b>\nPioneered by Canon, UA Lens technology makes possible compact lenses with remarkable optical performance. By using molded glass with an ultra-high refractive index in aspherical lens elements, Canon has succeeded in reducing lens size while significantly reducing image aberrations. Another stellar example of cutting-edge Canon optics, UA Lens technology helps make PowerShot digital cameras pocket-friendly and capable of astounding image quality.

Now, it’s difficult to find a big screen LED display that does not have Full HD 1080p resolution. Why was Full HD 1080p so important on 2D displays? Full HD 1080p offered more than two times the detail than non-Full HD panels. The more detail in the image the more realistic the image looks. The benefits of Full HD 3D works on the same principle, the more detail in the image the more realistic the experience. Viewing Full HD 3D can only be achieved using Active 3D shutter glasses technology.

Because no matter in which hand it’s held, the camcorder’s LCD screen will adjust to ensure that the picture is shown right-side up. More comfortable shooting while holding the camcorder vertically?

Send videos by uploading to Facebook™, Picasa™, Photobucket™ or email directly from the camcorder. You can also upload them to YouTube™ then sit back and wait for the rave reviews.

Details are as crisp and clear as if you were shooting from up close.\n\n<b>OIS Duo Plus</b>\nWith OIS (Optical Image Stabiliser) Duo Plus, you can capture clear and steady video, even if you have a case of shaky hands.

Automatically select from one of 11 preset modes - such as Night, Natural Green, Macro and Portrait - to instantly compensate for a variety of varying light conditions or image details. Never again miss shooting a spontaneous scene due to time-consuming setting adjustments.\n\n<b>Art Time-lapse Recording</b>\nCapture an event that takes place over the course of hours such the sun rising and setting and present it in a fraction of the time.

A variety of modes, including Night Time, Zooming, Panning and Reverse Playback, give you more creative options.\n\n<b>Record Pause</b>\nWhile shooting a video in Record Pause mode, it allows you to briefly pause the recording and then pick up right where you left off without creating a new file. This way you only have one file to work with and don’t have to merge files for editing, sharing or transferring.\n\n<b>Shake It</b>\nNext time you record a get-together, add some fun with Shake It. Just a couple of jostles of the camcorder can randomly add one of several different fun and artistic digital effects to a scene. Shake It even works in Playback Mode, when it will embed preloaded music into your clip.\n\n<b>2.7” Smart Touch LCD</b>\nChange the way you look at things with the 2.7"" QVGA Touch LCD (230k resolution).

The EXR-CMOS sensor has also been redesigned to prioritise light sensitivity with a 30% reduction in digital noise over its predecessor, ensuring smoother tones in both highlight and shadow areas at higher ISO settings.\n\nFujifilm’s acclaimed EXR AUTO mode assesses the amount of available light, establishes the type of scene, tracks motion and locates any people within the frame before applying Advanced Anti Blur technology and choosing one of three optimised settings: High Resolution Priority mode for well-lit subjects and optimum image quality, Dynamic Range Priority mode for scenes of high-contrast or High Sensitivity and Low Noise Priority mode for smooth, sharp images taken in dark environments. Users can also choose to select the modes themselves, but with EXR Auto mode’s 103 different shooting patterns that can be applied to a scene, it’s unlikely they’ll need to!\n\n<b>Always connected</b>\nWith the FinePix Z1000EXR, fast image upload to social networking sites no longer means low quality pictures. The camera can be connected with any Android smartphone/tablet or iPhone/iPad via the simple download of the "FUJIFILM Photo Receiver" free app to their device, which includes easy to follow instructions to get them quickly connected.\n\nTo start uploading, users press the FinePix Z1000EXR’s touch icon to connect to their smartphone and the images can be transferred to Android smartphone/tablet or iPhone/iPad ready for uploading to social networking sites.\n\nDespite the advanced imaging technology contained within the FinePix Z1000EXR, the camera’s menu system is designed to be both intuitive and easy to operate. The FinePix Z1000EXR’s wide 3.5-inch LCD offers touchscreen control with multi-touch capabilities for smartphone-style navigation. What’s more, the screen offers a 460,000 dots resolution for exceptional clarity when reviewing images and movie or composing a shot.\n\n<b>Capture the perfect face</b>\nIn addition to the advanced imaging technologies offered by the FinePix Z1000EXR, the camera also contains several features for improving the appearance of people in their photographs.\n\nFace tracking combines Face Detection with Tracking Auto Focus to ensure any faces in a scene are always sharp, no matter where they move. The camera itself has a wide-angle Frame Assist Mirror located and specially engineered to show the whole of a scene to assist users when framing a shot of themselves.\n\nIf there’s more than one person to capture on camera, the FinePix Z1000EXR offers innovative image timer technology for both couples and groups: activating Couple Timer and the camera waits until two faces are close together before capturing an image, while Self-portrait Timer detects up to four individual faces, giving friends and family time to get ready for their close-up.\n\nThe beautification doesn’t stop when the shutter button’s pressed. After capture, users can choose to apply face retouching functions (Skin smoothing/brighten) to improve appearance even further.\n\n<b>Choose your own shooting style</b>\nThe FinePix Z1000EXR isn’t just about still images – it also offers Full 1080p HD movie capture at a rate of 30fps for smooth and clear movies. Face Tracking Auto Focus locks on to any faces in the scene and will keep them sharp throughout filming, regardless of motion or the user recomposing the shot using the camera’s Fujinon 5x optical zoom lens. Stereo sound capture adds more realism to movies captured on the camera, and both stills and movie can be reviewed on an HD ready TV - when connected using the camera’s mini HDMI output.\n\nWhen capturing still images, the optical zoom lens’ range can be extended using the camera’s Intelligent Digital Zoom function. This assesses the zones of the photo and selectively applies image processing to increase the length of zoom to 10x without reduction in quality that’s normally associated with digital zoom enhancement. And if users want to get closer, the FinePix Z1000EXR offers a minimum focusing distance of 9cm for macro pictures full of colour and sharp detail.\n\n<b>Substance and style</b>\nIt may be packed with innovative photographic technology, but the FinePix Z1000EXR doesn’t compromise on appearances. Even though it’s only 18mm thick at its thickest point, the FinePix Z1000EXR appears even more sleek, streamlined and ready for anything.

A fast Dual CPU, gigabit network support and instant fusing technology ensures enhanced speed and less waiting time. Yet what sets it apart economically is the range of cost-effective and innovative features, such as high yield toner, low energy consumption and eco-friendly settings. It makes this medium workgroup printer as cost conscious as they come.\n\n<b>Now every workgroup can enjoy professional colour output</b>\nWhatever size your team, and however busy you are, you can rely on the CLP-680ND to constantly deliver professional, quality colour output.

It automatically sharpens the focus of both graphics and text, while solid objects are overlapped to eliminate white gaps.\n\n<b>Make colours more vibrant</b>\nOur newly developed polymerised toner has smaller and more uniform particles than conventional toner.
